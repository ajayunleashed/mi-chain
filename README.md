# Mi-Chain-refined

In current scenario the insurers interact with multiple third parties for fraud detection and prevention. Below are a few important third party systems that every insurer, as part of *Association of British Insures (ABI) integrates with:

  - Insurance Fraud Register (IFR)
  - Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE)
  - Motor Insurance Database (MID)
  - Motor Insurers Anti-Fraud and Theft Register (MIAFTR)

Centralized maintenance of such huge volume of insured data poses a considerable risk of cyber-attacks. For example The UK Insurance Fraud TaskForce Report highlights that a Sunday Times investigation found that the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) has been subjected to 264,484 attempted cyber-attacks in the last 3 and a half years. 

# Proposed Solution and Business Benefits 

The whole idea of MI-Chain is to eliminate the problem of having to integrate with multiple third party central databases for fraud detection.

The objective is to have every insurer enter fraud related data into the blockchain when the claim is created. All the insurers currently part of Association of British Insurers will form the closed group of peers for data sharing.
A blockchain platform reduces the need to integrate with multiple third parties as all the information required to tackle fraud are encrypted and maintained as a distributed ledger within the blockchain

# Integration with ML â€“ Fraud Detection As-a-service 
When the insurers form the closed group of peers, huge volumes of legitimate transactions data will be available for creating insights.

As the MI Chain contains massive amount of insurance data collected from across insurers, functionalities like Fraud Detection, Vehicle Drivers History, Claims History etc. could be provided as a service thus generating a new source of revenue from a business perspective

## Interacting with the Mi-Chain via HTTP

The MIChain defines a couple of HTTP API end-points and also serves some
static web content. The end-points allow you to list agreements and add
agreements.

The nodes can be found using the following port numbers, defined in
`build.gradle` and the respective `node.conf` file for each node found
in `kotlin-source/build/nodes/NodeX` or `java-source/build/nodes/NodeX`:

     NodeA: localhost:10007
     NodeB: localhost:10010
     NodeC: localhost:10013

Also, as the nodes start-up they should tell you which host and port the
embedded web server is running on. The API endpoints served are as follows:

     /api/example/me
     /api/example/peers
     /api/example/bls
     /api/example/{COUNTERPARTY}/create-bl

The static web content is served from:

     /web/example

An BL can be created via accessing the
`create-iou` end-point directly or through the the web form
hosted at `/web/example`.

**NOTE: The content in `web/example` is only available for demonstration
purposes and does not implement any anti-XSS/XSRF security techniques. Do
not copy such code directly into products meant for production use.**

**Submitting an BL via HTTP API:**

To create an BL from NodeA to NodeB, use:

     curl -X PUT 'http://localhost:10007/api/example/create-iou?iouValue=99&partyName=CN%3DNodeB%2CO%3DNodeB%2CL%3DNew%20York%2CC%3DUS'

Note the port number `10007` (NodeA), the IOU value `99` and the counterparty name `CN=NodeB,O=NodeB,L=New York,C=US`
referenced in the end-point path. This command instructs NodeA to create and send an IOU
to NodeB. Upon verification and completion of the process, both nodes
(but not NodeC) will have a signed, notarised copy of the IOU.

**Submitting an BL via `web/example`:**

Click the "Create BL" button at the top left of the page and enter the BL
details, e.g.

     Counter-party: CN=NodeB,O=NodeB,L=New York,C=US
     Value:  1

and click "Create BL". The modal dialogue should close.

To check what validation is performed on the BL data, have a look
at the `Create` class in `BLContract`. For example, Entering a
'Country Code' other than 'UK' will cause the verify function to return an
Exception and you should rceeive an error message in response.

**Viewing the submitted BL:**

Inspect the terminal for the nodes. You should see some activity in the
terminal windows for NodeA and NodeB:

*NodeA:*

     Generating transaction based on new BL.
     Verifying contract constraints.
     Signing transaction with our private key.
     Sending proposed transaction to recipient for review.
     Done

*NodeB:*

     Receiving proposed transaction from sender.
     Verifying signatures and contract constraints.
     Signing proposed transaction with our private key.
     Obtaining notary signature and recording transaction.
     Done

*NodeC:*

     You shouldn't see any activity.


**NOTE: These progress tracking messages are not currently visible in the Nodes, but they are visible on the NodeA WebServer terminal. Running the nodes with log-level DEBUG or TRACE should reveal extra activity when creating a new BL.**

Alternatively, try adding an BL with a delivery date in the past
or a delivery country other than the UK.

Next you can view the newly created BL by accessing the
vault of NodeA or NodeB:

**Via the HTTP API:**

For NodeA. navigate to
`http://localhost:10007/api/example/bls`. For NodeB,
navigate to `http://localhost:10010/api/example/bls`.

**Via web/example:**

Navigate to `http://localhost:10007/web/example/` and click the refresh
button at the top left-hand side of the page. You should see the newly
created BL on the page.

## Accessing a Node's Database via the h2 Web Console

You can connect to the h2 database to see the current state of the
ledger, among other data such as the network map cache.

Firstly, navigate to the folder where you downloaded the h2 web console
as part of the pre-requisites section, above.

Change directories to the bin folder:

     cd h2/bin

Where there are a bunch of shell scripts and batch files. Run the web
console:

**Unix:**

     sh h2.sh

**Windows::**

     h2.bat

The h2 web console should start up in a web browser tab. To connect we
first need to obtain a JDBC connection string. Each node outputs its
connection string in the terminal window as it starts up. In a terminal
window where a node is running, look for the following string:

     Database connection url is      : jdbc:h2:tcp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxxx/node

you can use the string on the right to connect to the h2 database: just
paste it in to the `JDBC URL` field and click *Connect* (leave the default username/password).

You will be presented with a web application that enumerates all the
available tables and provides an interface for you to query them using SQL.

## Interacting with MI-FraudPrediction via Rest WebService

To start , run command with:

     python MI_server.py

MI-FraudPrediction RestService can be accessible in http://127.0.0.1:5000/MI

To predict result , Access RestService endpoint and pass the input parameters in Endpoint URL as a QueryString

     e.g http://127.0.0.1:5000/MI/VRN/Make/plateTransfer
 Rest service will expect three input parameters to predict result (VRN/Make/plateTransfer) and will return the predicted result in JSON format

      e.g {"IsSuspectedFraud":"Yes"}
